# Static Bootstrap Web App

This is a static web application that loads Bootstrap from CDN and supports auto-reloading during development.

## Features
- Bootstrap 5 loaded via CDN
- Simple HTML/JS structure
- Auto-reloading dev server (see below)

## Development

To enable auto-reloading, install and run `live-server`:

```sh
npm install --save-dev live-server
npm start
```

Or use another static server with hot reload, such as `browser-sync`.

## File Structure
- `index.html` — Main HTML file
- `main.js` — JavaScript entry point
